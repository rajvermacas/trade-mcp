# Trading MCP Agile Development Plan
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: 2025-01-06  
**Project**: Trading MCP (Model Context Protocol) for Indian Stock Market  
**Development Approach**: MVP-First with Test-Driven Development  

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines a 5-stage agile development approach for the Trading MCP server, following an MVP-first methodology with strict Test-Driven Development practices. The project will create an MCP server that enables Large Language Models to access real-time Indian stock market data, calculate technical indicators, and retrieve market news through a standardized interface.

The MVP (Stage 1) will deliver a functional MCP server with basic stock data retrieval capabilities within 2 weeks, allowing immediate integration with Claude Desktop and other MCP clients. Subsequent stages will iteratively add technical indicators, news integration, performance optimizations, and advanced features based on user feedback.

Since this is a greenfield project with no existing code, all development will follow TDD principles from the start, ensuring high code quality and test coverage throughout the development lifecycle.
